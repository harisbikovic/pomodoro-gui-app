# Pomodoro GUI App
Welcome to the Pomodoro GUI App! This app is designed to help you manage your time more effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals of 25 minutes, separated by short breaks. This app provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for implementing the Pomodoro Technique on your computer.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use the Pomodoro GUI App, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: _https://www.python.org/downloads/_

## Installation
### First way
To install the app, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/harisbikovic/pomodoro_gui_app.git`

Navigate to your project directory. To run the app, simply run the **_main.py_** file:
`python main.py`

### Second way
If the previous is not your preferred way then do this:
1. Click on the green "Code" button, then select "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice on your computer
3. Navigate to the extracted ZIP file on your computer
4. Double-click the **_main.py_** file

Both of the previous two ways will launch the app window, which displays a timer and controls for starting and stopping the Pomodoro intervals. The default interval length is 25 minutes, with a short break of 5 minutes in between. After 4 Pomodoro intervals, a longer break of 15 minutes is taken.
